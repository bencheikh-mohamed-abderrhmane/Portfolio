## About The Project
I developed a fully functional and responsive e-commerce website specializing in video games, offering multiple catalogs tailored to different demographics: men, women, and children. Users can browse these catalogs, select their desired games, and add them to their cart or wishlist for future purchase. All selections are efficiently managed and stored via a robust back-end system.

The site includes an admin interface for managing products, including the ability to add new games. The front-end of the application is built with React, while the back-end handles requests and database operations, likely using a Node.js server and a MongoDB database.

Key features include displaying recent products, special offers, and an order management system. The checkout process allows users to fill in their information, choose a payment method, and receive a confirmation of their order.
