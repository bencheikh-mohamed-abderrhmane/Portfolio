## About The Project
The PokéList project is a dynamic web application built with React.js, designed to provide an interactive and engaging way to explore Pokémon. By leveraging a Pokémon API, the application fetches and displays detailed information about each Pokémon, including their abilities, stats, and types.

The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. Users can easily search for specific Pokémon by name or ID, view detailed profiles, and explore various Pokémon by scrolling through the list. The app efficiently handles API calls, ensuring fast and reliable data retrieval.

This project demonstrates the effective use of React components, state management, and API integration to create a user-friendly and visually appealing application.
